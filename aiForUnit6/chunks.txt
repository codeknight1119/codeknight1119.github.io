What is Artificial Intelligence? Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. These include problem-solving, recognizing speech, making decisions, and learning from experience.

AI systems use algorithms and data to "think" and adapt like humans, but they operate based on mathematical patterns rather than biological processes.

--- CHUNK 4 ---
History of AI ● AI's story begins in the 1950s when computer scientists first

asked: "Can machines think?"

The term "Artificial Intelligence" was coined at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956 by John McCarthy.

Early AI systems were simple by today's standards but revolutionary for their time.

Scientists created programs that could play checkers and solve basic math problems, laying the foundation for more complex systems.

--- CHUNK 5 ---
History of AI - Key Milestones

1950s: Alan Turing proposes the "Turing Test" to determine if a machine can think

1960s: ELIZA, an early natural language processing program, is created

1980s: Expert systems emerge for specialized tasks

1997: IBM's Deep Blue defeats chess champion Garry Kasparov

2011: IBM Watson wins Jeopardy! against human champions ● 2016: AlphaGo defeats world champion Go player Lee Sedol

--- CHUNK 6 ---
AI Revolution

From Rules to Learning Early AI systems followed strict rules programmed by humans.

Modern AI has evolved to learn from data without explicit programming. This shift represents a fundamental change in how AI works:

Rule-based systems → Learning systems ● Narrow applications → Broader capabilities ● Limited adaptability → Continuous improvement

This evolution has dramatically expanded what AI can accomplish in our world.

AI - The Basics

Input: Receive data (text, images, sounds, etc.)

Processing: Analyze data using algorithms

Pattern recognition: Identify patterns and relationships

Decision making: Determine appropriate responses

Output: Provide results (predictions, recommendations, actions)

Learning: Improve performance based on results

--- CHUNK 8 ---
Understanding AI Algorithms

Algorithms are step-by-step instructions that tell computers how to solve problems.

In AI, algorithms are specially designed to:

Process large amounts of data ● Identify patterns humans might miss ● Make predictions based on past observations ● Improve performance over time

These algorithms form the foundation of all AI systems, from simple chatbots to complex decision-making tools.

--- CHUNK 9 ---
How AI Uses Algorithms for Learning

Supervised Learning: Teaching by Example Supervised learning is

like learning with a teacher. The AI is trained on labeled data where the

correct answers are provided:

Input: The system receives data (e.g., pictures of animals)

Labels: Each input has a correct label (e.g., "cat," "dog")

Training: The system learns to connect inputs with correct labels

Testing: The system tries to label new, unseen examples

Application: Used for classification, prediction, and recognition tasks

Examples: Email spam filters, facial recognition, medical diagnosis

--- CHUNK 10 ---
AI Learning

Unsupervised Learning: Finding Hidden Patterns Unsupervised

learning is like exploring without a map. The AI discovers patterns

without being told what to look for (No Labels):

Input: The system receives unlabeled data

Analysis: The system looks for natural groupings or patterns

Discovery: The system identifies similarities and differences

Organization: The system categorizes data based on discovered patterns

Application: Used for clustering, anomaly detection, and data visualization

Examples: Social network analysis, recommendation systems

--- CHUNK 11 ---
AI in Healthcare

AI is transforming healthcare through:

Disease Detection: AI analyzes medical images to identify potential

diseases earlier and more accurately than traditional methods

Drug Discovery: AI accelerates the development of new

medications by predicting how different molecules will behave

Patient Monitoring: AI systems track patient vital signs and alert

medical staff to potential problems

Personalized Treatment: AI helps doctors create customized

treatment plans based on a patient's unique genetic makeup

--- CHUNK 12 ---
AI in Healthcare Real-world example: AI systems can detect signs of diabetic

retinopathy (an eye disease) from retinal scans with over 90%

accuracy.

Human accuracy in detecting diabetic retinopathy (especially early stages) typically ranges from 60% to 80%, depending on the experience of the clinician and image quality.

Lack of Creativity

AI can imitate creative works but struggles with true originality

AI-generated content is based on existing patterns in training data

Cannot experience genuine inspiration or imagination

May produce impressive results that appear creative but is actually

recombining existing ideas in new ways

Example: AI can write a poem that follows patterns of existing poetry but

doesn't understand the emotional meaning behind it

--- CHUNK 46 ---
Lack of Emotion

AI cannot truly feel emotions or understand them the way humans do

Can recognize patterns associated with emotions in text, speech, or facial

expressions

Cannot experience empathy, compassion, or emotional connection

May simulate emotional responses but these are programmed reactions

This limits AI in roles requiring emotional intelligence like counseling or

certain healthcare applications

--- CHUNK 47 ---
Hallucinations

"AI hallucinations" occur when AI systems generate false or made-up information

AI may present incorrect information with high confidence AI Hallucination - is an occurrence when an artificial intelligence system, like ChatGPT, confidently gives an answer that sounds correct but is actually false, made up, or misleading. It’s called a “hallucination” because the AI is not lying on purpose—it’s generating information that seems real based on patterns in its training data, even when no real evidence supports it.

--- CHUNK 48 ---
Hallucinations

"AI hallucinations" occur when AI systems generate false or made-up

information

AI may present incorrect information with high confidence

Causes of hallucinations include:

Gaps in training data

Confusion between similar concepts

Programming limitations

Example: An AI might confidently provide a detailed but completely fictional

biography of a person or invent statistics that sound plausible

--- CHUNK 49 ---
Lack of Understanding Context

AI has trouble understanding situations the way people do.

It can miss jokes, sarcasm, or cultural references.

It often doesn’t “get” things that are only hinted at, not clearly said.

AI doesn’t have the common sense that people learn from real-life experience.

Example: An AI might not understand that "it's raining cats and dogs" is a

figure of speech rather than a literal statement.

--- CHUNK 50 ---
Lack of Understanding Context

Context can sometimes be difficult for humans as well

a. Different age groups b. Different nationalities/ethnic groups c. Different cultures between departments within a company d. Different localities within the same country e. And more…

--- CHUNK 51 ---
Sometimes Generative AI goes bad. Can you spot some of the problems with these images??

--- CHUNK 52 ---
Key takeaway: This illustrates how AI struggles with organic structure, anatomy, and real-world consistency (ties into “lack of common sense/context”).

--- CHUNK 53 ---
Why AI Makes Weird Images

AI doesn’t understand anatomy or objects

It blends features from many images → weird results

Hands, teeth, and faces are hardest to get right

Shows AI’s limits: it imitates, not understands

--- CHUNK 54 ---
Key takeaway: Faces and small detailed features are also hard for AI because they require deeper understanding of structure and context. This shows the “hallucination” or “lack of context/emotion” limitation.
